# Projects 
Every Data Scientist needs a hub to showcase their growth, progress and projects. This repository containins my various DS Projects I've worked on.
As I upload more projects, I will give a brief summary of each project below.





## Covid-19 & Global Social Measures Team Project

This project spanned a couple weeks. I took the mantle of lead coder/developer for the project 
because I knew it would force me into a position requiring me to learn. By putting the weight (grade) of the entire project and my team's trust on myself, I knew I'd have to excel.
We found various global datasets on Kaggle and after settling on one major one, I took it from there. I cleaned, loaded, and explored my data to find any preliminary analysis. 
Since we decided on 4 countries to analyze, it would require 4 seperate models. 
After testing a couple linear regression models for performance, then choosing the best ones for each country, I visualized our findings. We matched these findings with 
real life Covid social measures and was able to suggest accurate and interesting inferences. This analysis is covered in the Research Paper. 



##  ETL Database Exercises 

This project was a string of exercises testing my ability to code proper ETL pipelines in order to create a database that could be visualized in Tableau. I was given various
csv files and was tasked with loading each into Pentaho and establishing a Fact Table at the end. The only dimension requiring additional work was the Date Dimension which needed
to be created from scratch. I simply simulated numerous dates for a specific span of time, masked and passed the values along, then loaded it into my final table.
Finally, after loading my tables into Tableau, I came up with two KPIs for the data and visualized accordingly. This is documented in the pdf. 



##  Titanic Random Forest Survivability

This is the first data science project/competition on Kaggle. I was given a training and testing data set and was tasked with building a Random Forest Model to accurately predict whether a sample of passengers either died or not. My model took certain variables, an n of 500 and accounted for an approximate 72% prediction success rate. I can improve this model by building a tree model, pruning and finding the optimal optimizations but this required different data than what was given. This was a fun first competition and refreshed my mind on how to work with decision models!


## Finance Data Capstone Project

This was a capstone project for the Python for Data Science course on Udemy. This allowed me to utilize all of my exploratory data analysis skills with financial data. From this project we can see some notable things in regards to these very large banks during the time period of 2006 - 2016. We can explore their returns, their opening vs closing prices, and how each of these things changed over the time frame. The amount of insight to be pulled is up to the viewer but using these EDA, statistical analysis and visualization skills, I can demonstrate outcomes that would've normally been hidden. Robust visualization skills are the mark of a good data scientist!
