# Projects
Every Data Scientist needs a hub to showcase their growth, progress and projects. This repository containins my various DS Projects I've worked on.
As I upload more projects, I will give a brief summary of each project below.


---  Covid-19 & Global Social Measures Team Project  ---

This project spanned a couple weeks. I took the mantle of lead coder/developer for the project 
because I knew it would force me into a position requiring me to learn. By putting the weight (grade) of the entire project and my team's trust on myself, I knew I'd have to excel.
We found various global datasets on Kaggle and after settling on one major one, I took it from there. I cleaned, loaded, and explored my data to find any preliminary analysis. 
Since we decided on 4 countries to analyze, it would require 4 seperate models. 
After testing a couple linear regression models for performance, then choosing the best ones for each country, I visualized our findings. We matched these findings with 
real life Covid social measures and was able to suggest accurate and interesting inferences. This analysis is covered in the Research Paper. 

---  ETL Database Exercises  ---

This project was a string of exercises testing my ability to code proper ETL pipelines in order to create a database that could be visualized in Tableau. I was given various
csv files and was tasked with loading each into Pentaho and establishing a Fact Table at the end. The only dimension requiring additional work was the Date Dimension which needed
to be created from scratch. I simply simulated numerous dates for a specific span of time, masked and passed the values along, then loaded it into my final table.
Finally, after loading my tables into Tableau, I came up with two KPIs for the data and visualized accordingly. This is documented in the pdf.
