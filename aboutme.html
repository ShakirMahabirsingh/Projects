  <h2> A Short Bit on Me </h2>
  <body>
      <p> Hello, world! </p>
      <p> Ok, now that I got the first coding joke out of the way, let me say a few things about myself.
        My name is Shakir M and I'm a Stats & Quant major at Baruch College in NYC. </p>
      <p> Due to the pandemic, all the students have been locked inside with all our time available to us.
        No more traveling and wasting all the hours commuting. In a place like NYC, it can reach up to 2hrs one way!
        I decided I didn't want to idle by and forget the coding I was doing during the semester so I joined this course. </p>
      <p> Hopefully the rest of this website functions properly and everything looks decent! </p>
